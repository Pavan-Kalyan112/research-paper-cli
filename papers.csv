"40635078","Erdafitinib inhibits the tumorigenicity of MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells by inducing TRIM25/ubiquitin-dependent degradation of FGFR4.","Qing Luo, Li Zhang, Yue Hao, Chunwei Xu, Xiaojia Wang, Zhen Jia, Xiandong Xie, Zhihong Huang, Xiaomin Gao, Yu Chen, Xue Zhu, Jing Fang, Ke Wang, Yongxiang Yin","Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most malignant subtype of breast cancer (BC), characterized by limited treatment options and poor clinical outcomes. Aberrant FGFR signaling has been implicated in TNBC; however, the therapeutic potential of targeting FGFRs for TNBC treatment remains unclear. This study investigated the anti-cancer activity of the selective pan-FGFR inhibitor Erdafitinib and its underlying mechanisms using both in vitro and in vivo models. The results demonstrated that Erdafitinib suppressed TNBC tumorigenicity by promoting FGFR1/4 degradation, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), inducing DNA damage, and ultimately triggering cell death. Mechanistic analyses revealed that Erdafitinib facilitated FGFR1/4 degradation through ubiquitination, enhanced interaction between TRIM25 and FGFR1/4, and subsequent lysosomal degradation. Furthermore, RNA-seq data from the TCGA and GEO databases, along with paired tumor tissues from TNBC patients, indicated that FGFR4 was significantly upregulated in TNBC. Notably, co-knockdown of FGFR1 and FGFR4 induced cytotoxicity in MDA-MB-231 cells, highlighting the therapeutic relevance of FGFR1/4 degradation by Erdafitinib in TNBC. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying the anti-cancer efficacy of Erdafitinib, supporting its potential as a promising therapeutic agent for TNBC.","2025","","wangke@jsinm.org.; yinyrh@jiangnan.edu.cn.","Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most malignant subtype of breast cancer (BC), characterized by limited treatment options and poor clinical outcomes.

The genetic components of risk can be divided into monogenic and polygenic factors. Just as monogenic factors can increase risk for more than one condition, polygenic factors may also underlie multiple phenotypes, including behavioral traits. In order to understand the biology of CRC risk better, it is important to understand the shared polygenic genetic architecture contributing to CRC risk and other phenotypes, including CRC associated risk factors.","2025","Roche","erosen@uw.edu.","Many factors, including environmental and genetic variables, contribute to Colorectal Cancer (CRC) risk.

The lack of clear guidelines leads to suboptimal management and poor prognosis. Molecular tumor boards accelerate access to effective therapies by tailoring treatment based on biomarkers, beyond cancer type. Unstructured data that requires manual curation hinders efficient use of biomarker profiling for therapy matching. This study explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to construct digital twins for precision medicine in RGTs. Our proof-of-concept digital twin system integrates clinical and biomarker data from institutional and published cases (n = 21) and literature-derived data (n = 655 publications) to create tailored treatment plans for metastatic uterine carcinosarcoma, identifying options potentially missed by traditional, single-source analysis. LLM-enabled digital twins efficiently model individual patient trajectories. Shifting to a biology-based rather than organ-based tumor definition enables personalized care that could advance RGT management and thus enhance patient outcomes.","2025","","Jacqueline.Lammert@tum.de.","Rare gynecological tumors (RGTs) present major clinical challenges due to their low incidence and heterogeneity.
