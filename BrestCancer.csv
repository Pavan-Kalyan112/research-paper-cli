"40635123","Single-Cell Transcriptome Analysis Uncovers La Ribonucleoprotein 6 (LARP6) as a Dual Regulator of Proliferation and Immune Infiltration in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.","Feng Yuan, Gai Liang, Qu Zhang, Bo Luo, Jianhua Liu, Xinhong Wu","Breast cancer is classified into multiple subtypes, including hormone receptor-positive (oestrogen/progesterone receptor, ER/PR), HER2-positive (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2), and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Among these, TNBC is more aggressive and susceptible to recurrence. The identification of novel TNBC-specific markers is crucial for the development of advancing therapeutic approaches for this subtype. In our study, firstly we integrated single-cell RNA sequencing data from more than 260,000 cells from previously published breast cancer datasets with ER-positive, HER2-positive and TNBC samples, determined the cell types based on the marker genes and identified the differentially expressed genes across various cell types between TNBC and ER/HER2-positive cancers using pseudobulk analysis. Additionally, we conducted gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) with the differentially expressed genes and identified 8 pathways which are consistent between the comparisons of TNBC/ER-positive and TNBC/HER2-positive. Furthermore, we found the shared gene, LARP6 (La Ribonucleoprotein 6) was significantly upregulated in TNBC compared to ER and HER2-positive breast cancers. Also, the result from survival analysis revealed that the high LARP6 level significantly affected patient survival. At last, we found LARP6 was highly expressed in the TNBC cell line, and knockdown of LARP6 reduced cell proliferation, which was associated with the cell cycle alterations as determined by TriCycle analysis. Immune infiltration analysis further revealed that LARP6 expression correlates with distinct immune cell populations in the tumour microenvironment, suggesting its role beyond cancer cell intrinsic functions.","2025","","","Breast cancer is classified into multiple subtypes, including hormone receptor-positive (oestrogen/progesterone receptor, ER/PR), HER2-positive (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2), and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).

"40635078","Erdafitinib inhibits the tumorigenicity of MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells by inducing TRIM25/ubiquitin-dependent degradation of FGFR4.","Qing Luo, Li Zhang, Yue Hao, Chunwei Xu, Xiaojia Wang, Zhen Jia, Xiandong Xie, Zhihong Huang, Xiaomin Gao, Yu Chen, Xue Zhu, Jing Fang, Ke Wang, Yongxiang Yin","Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most malignant subtype of breast cancer (BC), characterized by limited treatment options and poor clinical outcomes. Aberrant FGFR signaling has been implicated in TNBC; however, the therapeutic potential of targeting FGFRs for TNBC treatment remains unclear. This study investigated the anti-cancer activity of the selective pan-FGFR inhibitor Erdafitinib and its underlying mechanisms using both in vitro and in vivo models. The results demonstrated that Erdafitinib suppressed TNBC tumorigenicity by promoting FGFR1/4 degradation, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), inducing DNA damage, and ultimately triggering cell death. Mechanistic analyses revealed that Erdafitinib facilitated FGFR1/4 degradation through ubiquitination, enhanced interaction between TRIM25 and FGFR1/4, and subsequent lysosomal degradation. Furthermore, RNA-seq data from the TCGA and GEO databases, along with paired tumor tissues from TNBC patients, indicated that FGFR4 was significantly upregulated in TNBC. Notably, co-knockdown of FGFR1 and FGFR4 induced cytotoxicity in MDA-MB-231 cells, highlighting the therapeutic relevance of FGFR1/4 degradation by Erdafitinib in TNBC. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying the anti-cancer efficacy of Erdafitinib, supporting its potential as a promising therapeutic agent for TNBC.","2025","","wangke@jsinm.org; yinyrh@jiangnan.edu.cn","Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most malignant subtype of breast cancer (BC), characterized by limited treatment options and poor clinical outcomes.
