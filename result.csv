40624659,One step further in targeting acute leukemia by combining antibody-based immunotherapies and small molecule inhibitors.,2025,,,tohid_kazemi@yahoo.com.; s.taghilo@mazums.ac.ir.,"Here's a simple summary of the abstract:

Acute leukemia is a type of cancer where the bone marrow produces too many immature blood cells instead of healthy ones. This disease progresses quickly. Chemotherapy, which is commonly used to treat it, can have severe side effects. To address this, scientists have been working on new medicines that target specific molecules inside and outside the cancer cells themselves."

Lung cancer is a serious disease with high death rates. For a long time, treatments haven't been very effective. Researchers are working to find new and better ways to treat lung cancer by using cells from the immune system (the part of your body that fights off germs). One type of treatment called CAR-T therapy has worked well for some types of cancer, but it hasn't been as successful for lung cancer. To improve the results, scientists are trying different approaches, such as finding new targets to attack, making the treatments safer and more effective, and making them last longer. Other types of immune cell therapies are also being studied and might offer new options for treating lung cancer. Overall, this article summarizes recent progress and challenges in using these cellular immunotherapies to treat lung cancer."
