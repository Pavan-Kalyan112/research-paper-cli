"40635110","Association between metformin use and reduced short- and long-term all-cause mortality in patients undergoing cardiac surgery: a retrospective cohort study.","Bin Chen, Yanghao Tai, Yingming Kong, Chunyan Wang","The use of metformin during the perioperative period remains a contentious issue. This study aimed to assess the impact of metformin use on overall mortality rates among patients in postoperative cardiac intensive care units.","2025","","wangchunyan1@sxmu.edu.cn","The use of metformin during the perioperative period remains a contentious issue.

"40635026","Identification of lipid metabolism-related genes in myocardial infarction: implications for diagnosis and therapy.","Qiang Wang, Xian Wu, Bo Yu","Myocardial infarction(MI), a severe and often fatal cardiovascular condition, strongly contributes to global mortality and morbidity. Lipids are critical underlying factors in cardiovascular disease. They influence inflammatory responses and modulate leukocyte, vascular cell and cardiac cell functions, affecting the vasculature and heart. We aimed to identify novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for MI that are linked to lipid metabolism.","2025","","747847135@qq.com","Myocardial infarction(MI), a severe and often fatal cardiovascular condition, strongly contributes to global mortality and morbidity.

"40635006","Development and validation of an LDH-focused nomogram for the early prediction of heart failure in patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction after percutaneous coronary intervention.","Panting Wei, Jingjin Hou, Ruijiao Yu, Kun Na, Jiaqi He, Xiaojie Zhao, Ziqi Liu, Yan Xu, Yi Li, Chenghui Yan, Haibo Yu, Yaling Han","ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients remain at significant risk of heart failure (HF) despite successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) reperfusion, imposing a considerable public health burden. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a key enzyme in glycolysis, functions as a notable biomarker of cardiac pathology, yet it is frequently often overlooked in clinical practice. This study focused on establishing a nomogram incorporating LDH levels to assess the probability of HF occurring within one year following PCI in individuals who have previously experienced STEMI.","2025","","hanyalin@163.net; yuhaibo_74@126.com; yanch1029@163.com","ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients remain at significant risk of heart failure (HF) despite successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) reperfusion, imposing a considerable public health burden.

"40634843","The plasma lipopolysaccharide level is associated with contrast-induced acute kidney injury in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.","Haiqiang Shen, Qinghuan Yang, Xiaofu Zhang, Shan Qin, Yong Li, Jinqi Liu","Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plays an important role in cardiovascular and renal diseases. However, the relationship between LPS and contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role of LPS in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and its relationship with CI-AKI following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).","2025","","Liujinqi_321@163.com","Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plays an important role in cardiovascular and renal diseases.

The purposes of the current study were to identify the incidence, risk factors and trends of blood transfusion in shoulder arthroplasty patients over a 25-year period in a single, high-volume centre.","2025","","sezginmd@hotmail.com; mcitak@gmx.de","Management of blood transfusion in the peri-operative period of joint arthroplasties is often difficult and although associated risk factors and practice trends help ease this process, for shoulder arthroplasty, these aspects have not been explored as widely as other procedures.
