    "Publication Date": "2025",
    "Authors": "Carl Sars, Jan Frisell, Paul W Dickman, Helena Sackey, Ebba K Lindqvist",
    "Abstract": "Phyllodes tumors are rare fibroepithelial breast lesions graded as benign, borderline, or malignant. Surgical resection with clear margins is the primary method of treatment. Consensus on margin width could prevent unnecessary large primary resections or reoperations, yet the optimal margins for different tumor grades remain unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis will evaluate the effect of wide versus narrow margins on local recurrence rates after surgery for phyllodes tumors of the breast. In addition, the re-excision rates, adjuvant treatment and adverse events will be assessed.",

    "Abstract": "Drug repositioning offers a promising avenue for accelerating drug development and reducing costs. Recently, computational repositioning approaches have gained attraction for identifying potential drug-disease associations (DDAs). Biological entities such as drugs, genes, proteins, RNA, and diseases interact within a complex network. How to adequately extract the intrinsic relationships among them and accurately predict the drug-disease associations remains a challenge.",
