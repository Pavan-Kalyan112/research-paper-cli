    "abstract": "It remains a great challenge to control weeds in rapeseed fields in China. Breeding herbicide-resistant rapeseed varieties and using corresponding herbicide formulations has become the most economical and effective way to control weeds in rapeseed field. Characterization of more herbicide-resistant genetic resources will provide opportunities for breeders to develop rapeseed herbicide-resistant varieties with good agronomic performance. Previously, we obtained the tribenuron methyl (TBM)-resistant mutant K4 from ZS9 (Brassica napus L.) through ethyl methyl sulfonate mutagenesis and TBM foliar-spray screening. In this study, the inheritance and molecular characterization of the mutant K4 are carried out. Genetic investigation indicated that the herbicide-resistance of the K4 was controlled by one dominant allele at a single nuclear gene locus. Molecular characterization showed that a single point substitution at position 535 from C to T in BnAHAS3 (BnAHAS3",
