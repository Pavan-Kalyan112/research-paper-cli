"40626877","Influence of AI Decision Support on Radiologists' Performance and Visual Search in Screening Mammography.","Jessie J J Gommers, Sarah D Verboom, Katya M Duvivier, Cornelis Jan van Rooden, A Fleur van Raamt, Janneke B Houwers, Dick B Naafs, Lucien E M Duijm, Miguel P Eckstein, Craig K Abbey, Mireille J M Broeders, Ioannis Sechopoulos","This research aims to understand how an AI decision support system affects radiologists when interpreting mammograms for breast screening. The study involved 12 radiologists with varying experience who evaluated mammograms both without and with the use of an AI system that assigns a risk score from 1 to 100, with higher scores indicating a greater likelihood of malignancy. An eye tracker was used to monitor the radiologists' eye movements during the process.

The study compared the performance (Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity) between reading mammograms unaided and with the AI-assisted system using specialized software. Additionally, the reading times, percentage of breast covered by fixations, average fixation time, and time to first fixation within the lesion region were compared. The comparison was made using a statistical method called bootstrap resampling.

In simpler terms, this study explores how radiologists' performance changes when they interpret mammograms with and without AI assistance, and it also examines how their visual search patterns might differ in these two scenarios.","2025","","","Background Artificial intelligence (AI) decision support may improve radiologist performance during screening mammography interpretation, but its effect on radiologists' visual search behavior remains unclear. Purpose To compare radiologist performance and visual search patterns when reading screening mammograms with and without an AI decision support system. Materials and Methods In this retrospective multireader multicase study, 12 breast screening radiologists with 4-32 years of experience (median, 12 years) from 10 institutions evaluated screening mammograms acquired between September 2016 and May 2019. Assessments were conducted unaided and with a Food and Drug Administration-approved, European Commission-marked AI decision support system, which assigns a region suspicion score from 1 to 100, with 100 indicating the highest malignancy likelihood. An eye tracker monitored readers' eye movements. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity between unaided and AI-assisted reading were compared using multireader multicase analysis software. Reading times, breast fixation coverage (percentage breast covered by fixations within 2.5Â° visual angle radius), fixation time, and time to first fixation within the lesion region were compared using bootstrap resampling ("

These protocols reduce the time needed for the scan and increase availability of resources. However, they might slightly lower the accuracy (specificity) for radiologists when only these shorter scans are reviewed.

The study suggests an adaptive approach where a full MRI scan is performed only if an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based model detects any abnormalities in the abbreviated protocol. This approach aims to improve the accuracy of MRI screenings while also making them faster. The research in this paper seeks to evaluate the potential advantages of implementing such an adaptive strategy.","2025","","","Abbreviated breast MRI protocols are advocated for breast screening as they limit acquisition duration and increase resource availability. However, radiologists' specificity may be slightly lowered when only such short protocols are evaluated. An adaptive approach, where a full protocol is performed only when abnormalities are detected by artificial intelligence (AI)-based models in the abbreviated protocol, might improve and speed up MRI screening. This study explores the potential benefits of such an approach."

The AI system, called CadAI-B, runs on a tablet PC and can connect to an ultrasound device for real-time analysis.

The researchers evaluated the performance of this AI system by comparing it to expert evaluations. They looked at sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) as key measures. The study involved 33 patients, with 14 malignancies, 17 benign lesions, and 2 normal cases; 30 patients underwent biopsy.

The AI system correctly identified all malignant cases in real-time. While it had lower specificity for benign cases, the area under the curve (AUC) was high at 0.835 overall, and even higher at 0.850 when using a different scoring system called Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS).

The AI system categorized more benign cases as potentially requiring less invasive procedures, suggesting it might help reduce unnecessary biopsies. However, experts classified more of these cases as needing biopsy.

In conclusion, the study found that the real-time AI system could support detection during breast ultrasound scanning and may have potential for aiding differential diagnosis and reducing the need for unnecessary biopsies.","2025","","sgtw88@gmail.com","Existing artificial intelligence (AI) breast ultrasound solutions have limitations owing to their non-real-time detection and server dependency. However, novel real-time AI solutions enable on-device detection and differential diagnosis, aiding immediate decision-making. This study evaluated the feasibility of real-time artificial intelligence-based computer-aided detection/diagnosis (AI-CAD) for breast ultrasound in a clinical setting and assessed its preliminary efficacy in comparison with expert evaluations. A feasibility study was conducted from August to December 2023 at a tertiary medical center in Taiwan using a real-time AI solution (CadAI-B for Breast cancer). AI-CAD runs on a tablet PC and streams the display output from the ultrasound vendor's device via HDMI or DVI. Real-time AI-CAD was evaluated for detection and diagnostic performance based on sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC). The analysis included 33 patients with 14 malignancies, 17 benign lesions, and 2 normal cases; 30 (90.9%) underwent biopsy. AI-CAD successfully identified all malignancies in real-time. As AUCs were calculated using the malignancy score and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS), the overall diagnostic performances were 0.835 and 0.850, respectively. The per-patient sensitivity and specificity were 100.0% and 52.6%, respectively. The BI-RADS distribution was the same between AI-CAD and experts in malignant cases. In benign cases, AI-CAD categorized nine (50.0%) as C4A or C4B, whereas experts classified 13 (72.2%), indicating the potential to reduce the need for biopsy. Real-time AI-CAD is feasible for supporting detection during breast ultrasound scanning, with potential efficacy in aiding differential diagnosis and reducing the risk of unnecessary biopsies."
