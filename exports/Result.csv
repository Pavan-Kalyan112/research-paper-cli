"40642811","Risk vs. Benefit Analysis of Ultraviolet-C Advanced Aircraft Disinfection.","Gary R Allen, William D Mills, Diego M Garcia","This work provides details and references that help to quantify the benefits of using ultraviolet-C (UV-C) light for air disinfection in aircraft vs. the risk of overexposure to UV-C for passengers and crew. The analysis estimates that due to the combined transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 and Influenza A aboard commercial aircraft in the United States over the 3 yr through May 2023, there were on the order of 10,000 annual deaths, declining to 3,000/yr going forward, with an estimated annual economic burden of $200 billion. Up to 80% of the deaths and economic burden might be saved by supplementing the typical 30 air changes per hour of the aircraft ventilation system with a presently available 120 air changes per hour, using a UV-C disinfection system. The risks due to accidental overexposure to UV-C are orders of magnitude lower than the benefits. The 0.00003% risk of acute (one-time) overexposure for any given passenger may (or may not) result in a 1-2-day skin or eye irritation, with no long-term effects or risks, compared to the 15,000 times greater risk, at 0.5%, of contracting coronavirus disease 19 or Influenza A that persists for several days to weeks, and carries a risk of hospitalization or death. The estimated risk of non-melanoma skin cancer is virtually nil. Allen GR, Mills WD, Garcia DM. Risk vs. benefit analysis of ultraviolet-C advanced aircraft disinfection.

"40642769","Surveillance of severe acute respiratory infections associated with SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus and RSV using ICD-10 codes: a case definition accuracy study across five European countries, 2021 to 2023.","Miguel Angel Sanchez Ruiz, Diogo Fp Marques, Frederikke Kristensen Lomholt, Lasse Skafte Vestergaard, Susana Monge, Marcos Lozano Álvarez, Gudrun Aspelund, Marianna Thordardottir, Ausra Dziugyte, John-Paul Cauchi, Tjarda M Boere, Irene K Veldhuijzen, Elina Seppälä, Håkon Bøås, Trine Hessevik Paulsen, Ausenda Machado, Ana Paula Rodrigues, Mariette Hooiveld, Luis Alves de Sousa, Ana Torres, Carlos Carvalho, Baltazar Nunes","BACKGROUNDSurveillance of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) using ICD-10 codes from electronic health records (EHR) lacks consensus on optimal case-defining codes.AIMWe determined codes that maximise sensitivity (Se) and positive predictive value (PPV) for SARI associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in Denmark, Iceland, Malta, Norway and Spain.METHODSWe included hospitalisations from week 21/2021 to 39/2023, with ICD-10 diagnostic codes for respiratory disease (three-character codes J00-J99) or COVID-19 (U07.1, U07.2, country-specific codes for Denmark). We assessed Se and PPV of individual codes against laboratory results. Based on Se and PPV rank-sum, we selected the top 10 codes and combined them into 10 sets per pathogen. We identified sets that maximised the clinical utility index (CUI = Se × PPV), categorised as excellent (≥ 0.81), good (0.64-0.80), satisfactory (0.49-0.63) and poor (< 0.49).RESULTSWe assessed 395,163 hospitalisations for SARI-SARS-CoV-2, 313,418 for SARI-influenza and 192,936 for SARI-RSV, all tested. For SARI-SARS-CoV-2, code U07.1 (B34.2A, B97.2A for Denmark) had excellent utility in Denmark, Malta, Norway, Spain (≥ 0.82), and good utility in Iceland (0.79). For SARI-influenza, J09, J10 and J11 performed excellently in Denmark, Norway, Spain (≥ 0.83), satisfactorily in Malta (0.52), and poorly in Iceland (0.43). For SARI-RSV, J12, J20 and J21 achieved highest CUI but had poor utility (0.17-0.34).CONCLUSIONSCOVID-19- and influenza-specific three-character ICD-10 codes accurately identified SARI associated with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus. For SARI-RSV, four-character codes should be explored. We recommend context-specific assessments in countries adopting EHR-based surveillance.","2025","","","BACKGROUNDSurveillance of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) using ICD-10 codes from electronic health records (EHR) lacks consensus on optimal case-defining codes.AIMWe determined codes that maximise sensitivity (Se) and positive predictive value (PPV) for SARI associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in Denmark, Iceland, Malta, Norway and Spain.METHODSWe included hospitalisations from week 21/2021 to 39/2023, with ICD-10 diagnostic codes for respiratory disease (three-character codes J00-J99) or COVID-19 (U07.1, U07.2, country-specific codes for Denmark).

"40642339","A Roadmap for the Application of Convalescent Plasma and Hyperimmune Globulins in Emerging Viral Outbreaks.","Aliasghar Rahimian, Hooman Askari, Ali Nabati, Mahdi Aminian","The outbreak of COVID-19 took the world by surprise and dealt a serious blow to the global economy. Even today, few drugs against SARS-CoV-2 infection have been proven useful, and repurposing existing antiviral therapies remains a major research area in the treatment of the disease. During previous viral outbreaks, therapies using convalescent plasma and related products have repeatedly been used as empirical approaches. Rapid preparation of convalescent plasma and hyperimmune globulins (hIVIGs) makes these two treatment options useful in dealing with outbreaks of emerging diseases. The current study presents a systematic roadmap concerning the guidelines, criteria, and regulations involved in plasma transfusion and the preparation of hIVIGs applicable to possible future viral outbreaks.","2025","","","The outbreak of COVID-19 took the world by surprise and dealt a serious blow to the global economy.
