    "Abstract": "Wo rldwide, breast cancer (BC) tops as the main cause of cancer deaths among females. Women who are diagnosed with breast cancer experience body changes, and these could lead to devastating social and economic consequences on the patients. However, there is minimal exploration on the physical and socioeconomic needs of women diagnosed with breast cancer in resource-constrained settings, hence this study.",

    "summary": "This research focuses on a significant issue: breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths among women worldwide. When women are diagnosed with breast cancer, they may experience various physical changes that can have severe social and economic impacts on their lives. However, there's not much research about the specific physical and socioeconomic needs of these women, particularly in resource-limited areas. This study aims to address this gap by exploring these needs in detail for women with breast cancer in resource-constrained settings."

    "Abstract": "With the rapid introduction of novel breast cancer therapies, recognizing and managing side effects is essential to maintain adherence and improve outcomes. As novel oral endocrine therapies and combination strategies including targeted agents have prolonged progression and in some cases disease-free survival, early recognition and appropriate management of these toxicities is critical to optimize quality of life. Dermatologic adverse events are frequently associated with novel breast cancer therapies including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), targeted therapies, and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). These include various rashes, stomatitis, and alopecia, necessitating multidisciplinary dermatologic intervention to allow for prompt management of cutaneous toxicities and continuation of oncologic therapy. Targeted breast cancer therapies, including ADCs, can also induce ocular adverse events (OAEs), such as corneal pseudomicrocysts which lead to blurry vision and eye pain. Current preventative therapies have had limited success for these OAEs, necessitating dose interruptions. Although anthracycline-based chemotherapy and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted therapy are associated with an increased risk of heart failure and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, novel breast cancer therapies including ADCs, HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitors, ICIs, and oral selective estrogen receptor degrader are also associated with an increased risk of LV dysfunction, heart failure, corrected QT prolongation, myocarditis, and bradycardia. This review provides a comprehensive overview of novel and emerging breast cancer therapy toxicities, with suggested management strategies to prevent and mitigate these adverse events. Through a multidisciplinary approach involving preventative strategies, monitoring, proactive interventions, providers can minimize symptom burden and improve patient adherence, ultimately improving breast cancer outcomes.",

    "summary": "This research is about managing side effects of new breast cancer treatments, which are becoming more common. These therapies can cause various skin problems like rashes, mouth sores, and hair loss, as well as eye problems like blurry vision and eye pain. The study highlights the need for dermatologic intervention (skin-related medical care) to manage these side effects quickly and continue cancer treatment.\n\nThe research also mentions that some new breast cancer treatments can cause heart problems such as heart failure, irregular heart rhythms, and LV dysfunction (a condition where the left ventricle of the heart doesn't pump blood effectively). The authors suggest a multidisciplinary approach to prevent and manage these side effects, including preventative strategies, monitoring, and proactive interventions. This approach aims to reduce patient discomfort, improve adherence to treatment, and ultimately lead to better breast cancer outcomes."

Natural extracts such as rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) and capsicum (Capsicum annuum L.), traditionally used for various medicinal purposes in Egypt, are widely utilized in treatments for androgenetic alopecia and hair care products. However, these extracts lack market standardization and clear specifications, leading to inconsistent and unpredictable effects.",

    "summary": "This research is about two natural extracts, rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) and capsicum (Capsicum annuum L.), which are often used in treatments for a common condition called alopecia (hair loss). These extracts have been traditionally used in Egypt for various medicinal purposes. The study mentions that these extracts are currently being used in treatments for androgenetic alopecia and hair care products worldwide.\n\nHowever, the research highlights a problem: there's a lack of standardization and clear specifications in how these extracts are produced, leading to inconsistent results when using them. This means that their effects can be unpredictable, which might not be ideal for people who are using these treatments or products for hair care purposes. The research suggests that addressing this issue could lead to more reliable and effective use of these natural extracts in treating alopecia and improving hair health."

    "Title": "Exploring the molecular mechanism of Polygonum multiflorum in treating androgenic alopecia based on the methods of bioinformatics and molecular docking.",
    "Publication Date": "2025",
    "Authors": "Xiaojiao Zhong, Cong Jing",
    "Abstract": "This study aims to research and discuss the molecular mechanism of Polygonum multiflorum (PM) to treat androgenic alopecia (APA). The target network and protein interaction network of APA of PM were established using traditional Chinese medicine molecular mechanism bioinformatics databases and disease gene databases. The core subnetworks were screened based on topological analysis, and Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses were performed, molecular docking of the 10 genes with the highest connectivity. According to the intersection of active components and potential targets of PM, 1325 common target factors were obtained. The core subnetwork composed of 66 genes was screened by topological analysis. The results of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment showed that PM mainly exerts biological functions by regulating inflammatory response, oxidation stress, apoptosis, autophagy, and other pathways. The result of molecular docking shows that the binding energies of HRAS, PIK3CA, PIK3CB, and RHOA -resveratrol, -polygonin, -chrysophanol, -rheum emodin, and -rhein were all <-9 kcal/mol. PM's mechanism in treating APA may regulate the expression of PIK3CA and PIK3CB through the emodin-mediated phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B pathway to regulate cell apoptosis. In addition, some processes, such as inhibiting inflammation, oxidative stress, and inducing melanin production, are also involved. PM has application value in treating APA and can be popularized after testing.",

    "summary": "This research focuses on understanding how Polygonum multiflorum (PM) could potentially treat Androgenic Alopecia (hair loss). The researchers built a network of genes and proteins related to APA using bioinformatics tools and databases. They identified key subnetworks and analyzed their functions using Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.\n\nMolecular docking, which predicts how small molecules (like components in PM) might bind to proteins, was used to identify the 10 genes with the strongest connections. The researchers then found 1325 common factors between these genes and the active components of PM.\n\nThe core subnetwork consists of 66 genes. Enrichment analysis suggested that PM primarily affects biological functions by regulating inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis (cell death), autophagy (self-destruction of cells), and other pathways in treating APA.\n\nMolecular docking results showed that four genes (HRAS, PIK3CA, PIK3CB, and RHOA) had strong binding affinity with several PM compounds like resveratrol, polygonin, chrysophanol, rheum emodin, and rhein.\n\nThe researchers propose that PM may treat APA by regulating the expression of PIK3CA and PIK3CB through an emodin-mediated phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B pathway, which in turn regulates cell apoptosis. Additionally, PM may inhibit inflammation, reduce oxidative stress, and stimulate melanin production to treat APA. The research suggests that PM could be useful for treating APA after further testing."

    "Abstract": "Despite the wide variety of treatment options for alopecia areata (AA), androgenetic alopecia (AGA), and primary cicatricial alopecias, these options become more limited for women who are breastfeeding,\u00a0given concerns surrounding potential transfer into breast milk and subsequent adverse effects (AEs) on the newborn infant. Alopecia is associated with significant psychological distress, poorer quality of life (QOL), and negative impacts on self-esteem and body image, which may be exacerbated by undergoing the physical, hormonal, and emotional changes of pregnancy and breastfeeding. Furthermore, many of these medications must be taken continuously to maintain their benefits, reinforcing the importance of understanding which therapies are compatible with breastfeeding. This review aimed to help guide clinicians in choosing safe and appropriate hair loss therapies for women during lactation, including a detailed discussion of medication transfer to breast milk and infant blood serum levels, potential neonatal AEs, and further clinical considerations specific to each treatment option.",

    "summary": "This research focuses on finding safe and effective hair loss treatments for breastfeeding women, who often have limited options due to concerns about the drugs passing into breast milk and affecting their newborn infants. Hair loss conditions like alopecia areata (AA), androgenetic alopecia (AGA), and primary cicatricial alopecias can cause distress, impact quality of life, and affect self-esteem and body image. As breastfeeding involves physical, hormonal, and emotional changes, it's crucial to understand which treatments are compatible with breastfeeding.\n\nThe study provides a detailed review of various hair loss therapies, discussing how each medication may transfer into breast milk, the potential adverse effects on infants, and additional clinical considerations for each treatment option. The goal is to help healthcare professionals make informed decisions about safe and appropriate treatments for breastfeeding women dealing with hair loss issues."
