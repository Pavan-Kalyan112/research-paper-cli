"40636380","Salvage chemotherapy in the intensive care unit: a case report of successful treatment of a critically ill patient with metastatic testicular germ cell tumor.","Karol Grela, Mykola Sobchynskyi, Mateusz Piȩtak, Barbara Kruczyk, Piotr Domański, Jakub Kucharz, Małgorzata Symonides, Tomasz Demkow","Testicular cancer, predominant among young males, poses a significant healthcare challenge with varying incidence rates across European regions. Germ cell tumors (GCTs), constituting 95% of the cases, can be divided into seminoma and non-seminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCTs). Metastases commonly occur in the lungs, lymph nodes, liver, bone, and brain. This study focuses on a 23-year-old with metastatic NSGCT, who underwent chemotherapy in an intensive care unit setting, followed by a remarkable improvement in his condition. The patient's initial complaint was persistent abdominal pain, which led to a discovery of an extensive tumor in the abdominal cavity. He underwent cytoreductive surgery, and required admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) due to surgical complications. Histopathology identified a yolk sac tumor. Despite the serious condition, chemotherapy was started. The patient's condition continued to deteriorate, requiring the initiation of mechanical ventilation. However, the multidisciplinary team opted for a continued treatment. Eventually, the AFP levels started to decrease and a gradual improvement of the patient's condition have been observed. This allowed to a bleomycin, etoposide, and platinum regimen. Following a complex hospitalization and subsequent surgical resection of residual lesions, the patient remains in good clinical condition. Regular follow-up evaluations have revealed no evidence of disease recurrence. Although NSGCT is characterized by a rather favorable prognosis, it is a significant challenge to clinicians, as the diagnosis is often delayed due to the lack or low specificity of the symptoms. Despite the usually young age of the patients diagnosed with metastatic NSGCT, the patients condition can deteriorate rapidly, presenting with multiorgan failure and a need for an ICU treatment. However, the severity of the patients' condition should not be unequivocally associated with being not suitable for a systemic curative treatment. Such patients can still benefit from the chemotherapy, and a cooperation between the oncologists and critical care physicians is crucial to improving the outcomes and increase the probability of recovery.","2025","","","Testicular cancer, predominant among young males, poses a significant healthcare challenge with varying incidence rates across European regions.

"40635989","New approaches to overcome radioresistance in glioblastoma: mechanisms, targets and role of innovative therapies, new particles and non-photon radiotherapy in 2024. A systematic review.","Kamel Debbi, Gokoulakrichenane Loganadane, Nhuhanh To, Mohamed Aziz Cherif, Chahrazed Boukhobza, Hanan Rida, Noémie Grellier, Hamid Mammar, Yazid Belkacemi","Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent and deadliest form of primary malignant brain tumor in adults. Radiation associated with chemotherapy following maximal feasible surgery is the standard of care. However, it remains an incurable disease with inexorable recurrence after multimodal therapy due to several factors including tumor aggressiveness with high degree of tumor cell infiltration into surrounding brain tissue, high proliferation, molecular heterogeneity and radioresistance. A better understanding of the tumor biology may allow development of new strategies to overcome treatment resistance. Overcoming radioresistance in GBM has been considered as a challenge for decades. In this systematic review we aim to summarize biologic pathways and mechanisms of therapeutic resistance involved in GBM and try to define some potential future therapeutic perspectives. The main mechanisms of radioresistance that we will discuss are hypoxia, the subpopulation of cancer stem cells in GBM, and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression. We will also focus on the potential role of innovative approaches, such as targeted therapy, nanoparticles and non-photon radiotherapy.","2025","","","Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent and deadliest form of primary malignant brain tumor in adults.

"40635765","From Microbial Homeostasis to Systemic Pathogenesis: A Narrative Review on Gut Flora's Role in Neuropsychiatric, Metabolic, and Cancer Disorders.","Xili Yan, Liangbin Shi, Xiuling Zhu, Yingdi Zhao, Jie Luo, Qiang Li, Zhiliang Xu, Jian Zhao","As a pivotal ecological regulator in humans, the gut microbiota profoundly participates in the pathological processes of neurodegenerative diseases, psychiatric disorders, metabolic syndromes, and cancers through metabolite exchange, epigenetic regulation, and gut-brain axis signaling. This review focuses on analyzing relationships between gut microbial communities and four major disease spectra: neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease)-revealing microbiota-derived lipopolysaccharide activation of microglia and gut-brain transmission pathways of α-synuclein; mental health disorders (depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder)-elucidating dysregulated tryptophan metabolism and gut-derived neurotransmitter imbalances; metabolic diseases (obesity, diabetes, gout)-analyzing molecular mechanisms by which short-chain fatty acids regulate insulin sensitivity and uric acid metabolism; malignant tumors (lung cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer)-exploring microbial remodeling of immune checkpoint inhibitor responses and regulatory effects on estrogen metabolism. We integrate existing evidence to systematically expound the roles of gut microbiota alterations in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, psychiatric disorders, metabolic dysregulation, and malignant tumors, with in-depth analysis of mechanisms through which dysbiosis promotes disease progression, aiming to provide a theoretical foundation and scientific recommendations for developing microbiota-targeted precision intervention strategies (including, but not limited to synthetic microbial community transplantation and metabolite-directed regulation).","2025","","","As a pivotal ecological regulator in humans, the gut microbiota profoundly participates in the pathological processes of neurodegenerative diseases, psychiatric disorders, metabolic syndromes, and cancers through metabolite exchange, epigenetic regulation, and gut-brain axis signaling.
