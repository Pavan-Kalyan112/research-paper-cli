    "Abstract": "Smoking is a leading cause of various health conditions, including cancer and respiratory diseases. Smokers often face medical restrictions such as limitations in blood and organ donation, reduced effectiveness of medications, and increased surgical complications. These impacts underscore the need for early detection of smoking status to enable timely intervention. This study explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to predict smoking status based on health parameters, including biosignals and clinical biomarkers. A balanced subset of 2,000 instances was sampled from a publicly available Kaggle dataset comprising clinical and biometric features. Multiple ML models were implemented, including Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors, CatBoost Classifier, and an Artificial Neural Network. The Random Forest Classifier achieved the better performance with an accuracy of 0.80, precision of 0.80, recall of 0.80, and F1-score of 0.79. To enhance model interpretability, four Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques were applied: Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), QLattice, and Anchor. SHAP identified hemoglobin as the most influential predictor, while LIME, QLattice, and Anchor highlighted the role of gamma-glutamyl transferase (t). Interactions between hemoglobin, GTP, and height were associated with more accurate predictions. The integration of ensemble modeling and multiple XAI approaches offers deeper interpretability than prior studies, providing healthcare providers and policymakers with a robust, transparent decision-support tool for targeted intervention strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Despite a healthy lifestyle being linked to reduced colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, prior studies using surveys to measure lifestyle factors failed to consider potential inter-individual heterogeneity in metabolic responses. We aimed to characterize a metabolic signature as a measure of metabolic responses to a healthy lifestyle and evaluate its association with CRC risk.",

    "Abstract": "Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematopoietic stem cell malignancy, driven by the pathognomonic oncogenic fusion protein BCR::ABL1. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting ABL1 have increased the life expectancy of patients with CML to near levels of age-matched healthy individuals. Intriguingly, the response to TKIs varies substantially and is related to observations that CML leukemic stem cells (LSCs) are less sensitive to TKIs. LSC-derived suboptimal response is suggested to explain failing treatment free remission (TFR) in approximately 60% of patients after stopping TKI treatment. Identification of novel and druggable targets on CML LSCs is a possible pathway for increasing TFR. Here we will focus on the role of CML LSCs in initial patient response to TKI therapy, and the possible interactions that LSC may experience in the bone marrow stroma. Adaptation of LSC and stroma is likely to play a central role in the heterogenous responses. Even if overall survival in CML is outstanding, deeper understanding of LSC biology may help more patients to avoid life-long therapy.",

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of OBI in a region of Uganda with high HBV endemicity, in order to help explain variations in HBV distribution within the country.",
