"40630518","SARS-CoV-2 vaccination unmasks distinct immune dysfunctions across lymphoma subtypes and therapies.","Yogambigai Velmurugu, Anna Halling Folkmar Rahimic, Ryan Curtin, Yuan Hao, Samantha Nyovanie, James Langton, Pamela Mishra, Iryna Voloshyna, Akiko Koide, Shohei Koide, Gregg J Silverman, Ramin Sedaghat Herati, Yury Patskovsky, Catherine Diefenbach, Michelle Krogsgaard","Patients with lymphoma are at increased risk of severe infections, including SARS-CoV-2, due to immune suppression. Using multidimensional spectral flow cytometry and serology, we characterized in-depth immune responses in 50 SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated lymphoma patients across12 lymphoma subtypes, treated with anti-CD20 antibody (aCD20) ± chemotherapy (CT) or CT alone. Compared to healthy control, aCD20±CT-treated patients exhibited distinct immune alterations, including elevated late-stage effector memory (EM3) CD4+, and terminally differentiated (EMRA) CD8+ T cells, reduced circulating T follicular helper (cTfh) cells, and increased dysfunctional DN3 B cells. While B cell depletion was expected with aCD20 therapy, our data reveals broader immune dysregulation beyond B cell loss. Consistent with these phenotypic changes, aCD20±CT treated patients showed impaired vaccine-induced antibody and T-cell responses. In contrast, CT-only Hodgkin lymphoma patients maintained antibody responses comparable to healthy controls. Notably, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in aCD20±CT treated patients displayed fewer regulatory T cells, increased Th1 population, and more EMRA CD8+ T cells, suggesting a compensatory T-cell mediated immunity. Antibody response correlated positively with naïve T cell frequencies and transitional, classical memory, and DN2 B cell subsets. These findings inform the tailored development of vaccine strategies for immunocompromised patients to enhance protection against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and other viral pathogens.","2025","","","Patients with lymphoma are at increased risk of severe infections, including SARS-CoV-2, due to immune suppression.

"40630514","Vaccine Effectiveness Among 5- to 17-year-old Individuals with Prior SARS-CoV-2 Infection: An EHR-Based Target Trial Emulation Study from the RECOVER Project.","Yong Chen, Yuqing Lei, Jiajie Chen, Qiong Wu, Ting Zhou, Bingyu Zhang, Michael Becich, Yuriy Bisyuk, Saul Blecker, Elizabeth Chrischilles, Dimitri Christakis, Lindsay Cowell, Mollie Cummins, Soledad Fernandez, Daniel Fort, Sandy Gonzalez, Sharon Herring, Benjamin Horne, Carol Horowitz, Mei Liu, Susan Kim, Parsa Mirhaji, Abu Mosa, Jennifer Muszynski, Catharine Paules, Alice Sato, Hayden Schwenk, Soumitra Sengupta, Srinivasan Suresh, Bradley Taylor, David Williams, Yongqun He, Jeffrey Morris, Ravi Jhaveri, Christopher Forrest","The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear, particularly for Omicron subvariants. We evaluated vaccine effectiveness against reinfection with Omicron BA.1/2, BA.4/5, XBB, and later subvariants among 5- to 17-year-olds using data from the RECOVER initiative, a national electronic health record database covering 37 U.S. pediatric institutions. We emulated target trials by age group and variant period, comparing previously infected participants between January 2022 and August 2023. During the BA.1/2 period, vaccination reduced the risk of reinfection, with effectiveness rates of 62% in children and 65% in adolescents. During the BA.4/5 period, protection effectiveness in children was 57%, whereas no statistically significant protection was observed in adolescents. During the XBB or later period, no significant protection was observed in either group. In summary, COVID-19 vaccination provided protection against reinfection during early and mid-Omicron periods in previously infected pediatric populations, but effectiveness declined for later variants.","2025","","","The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in children and adolescents with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear, particularly for Omicron subvariants.

"40630377","COVID-19 Vaccine Willingness and Education Level: A Multinational Cross-Sectional Analysis.","Samantha R Karp, Youry B Jean, Opeoluwa A Ashiru, Shahid B Rangrej","Purpose This study aims to examine the relationship between individuals' education levels and their willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Understanding vaccine willingness and its influences allows for the identification of vulnerable communities in the face of global viral pandemics such as COVID-19. By identifying vulnerable populations, such as individuals who have restricted access to education, public health officials can create more effective targeted interventions to increase vaccine willingness and uptake. Methodology Surveys were administered online and in person, targeting adults aged 18 years or older, and were designed to achieve broad geographical reach. Participants self-reported their highest level of education and rated statements related to COVID-19 vaccine willingness, perceived importance, and understanding. Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel for Mac (version 16.70 23021201) (Microsoft® Corp., Redmond, WA). Results Results from our study demonstrate that individuals with higher education levels were significantly associated with greater vaccine willingness (B = -0.99, p < .001); since reverse scoring was utilized, lower willingness scores reflected greater willingness. The regression model accounted for 36.4% of the variance in willingness (R² = 0.364), suggesting a moderate to strong relationship within our sample. Conclusion As vaccine hesitancy remains a global challenge, our findings highlight education level as a potential strategy for addressing vaccine willingness across multiple countries within our sample. Having a well-rounded understanding of the key factors that influence vaccine willingness is significant for informing efficient public health policies.","2025","","","Purpose This study aims to examine the relationship between individuals' education levels and their willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.

"40630110","Retrospective case study of the impacts of multiple One Health oriented biocontainment research facilities during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Renata S M Landers, Paul D Hodgson, Michael Puckette, Sankar P Chaki, William Wilson, Stephen Higgs, Kurt A Zuelke","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic revealed the importance of rapidly identifying and controlling zoonotic diseases and underscored the necessity of coordinating and planning pandemic preparedness with comprehensive one health strategies to prevent and control the emergence and transmission of zoonotic pathogens. The present case study catalogued the scope and range of activities performed by the biocontainment research facilities that ultimately comprised the Research Alliance for Veterinary Science and BSL-3 Biodefense Network (RAV3N) created during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Results revealed that nearly all RAV3N members directly contributed to all aspects of the response against the pandemic, from human diagnostic testing to specialized animal disease models for developing medical countermeasures to investigating the potential for pets and wildlife to serve as potential reservoirs for the SARS-CoV-2. Reflecting their expertise, approximately 80 % of members developed multiple animal models as part of their SARS-CoV-2 research. RAV3N members investigated basic virology, transmission, and host susceptibility in animal models ranging from non-human primates and livestock, to wildlife, arthropods, and mice. Approximately half of member institutions provided SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing services and/or environmental wastewater testing and surveillance to augment limited public health laboratory capacity during the pandemic. State and Federal sources funded and authorized all the reported response activities, however only 40 % of these response activities were coordinated with local public health officials. A major recommendation is to improve direct communication and pandemic response planning between the veterinary science and zoonotic disease and human public health communities. RAV3N provides a model for sharing information and coordinating response activities between veterinary science and public health officials in future disease outbreaks.","2025","","","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic revealed the importance of rapidly identifying and controlling zoonotic diseases and underscored the necessity of coordinating and planning pandemic preparedness with comprehensive one health strategies to prevent and control the emergence and transmission of zoonotic pathogens.
