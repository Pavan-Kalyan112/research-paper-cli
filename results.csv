Potential Time and Recall Benefits for Adaptive AI-Based Breast Cancer MRI Screening.,"Luuk Balkenende, Jonatan Ferm, Vivien van Veldhuizen, Joren Brunekreef, Jonas Teuwen, Ritse M Mann","Abbreviated breast MRI protocols are advocated for breast screening as they limit acquisition duration and increase resource availability. However, radiologists' specificity may be slightly lowered when only such short protocols are evaluated. An adaptive approach, where a full protocol is performed only when abnormalities are detected by artificial intelligence (AI)-based models in the abbreviated protocol, might improve and speed up MRI screening. This study explores the potential benefits of such an approach.",
Performance of a deep-learning-based lung nodule detection system using 0.25-mm thick ultra-high-resolution CT images.,"Haruka Higashibori, Wataru Fukumoto, Sayaka Kusuda, Kazushi Yokomachi, Hidenori Mitani, Yuko Nakamura, Kazuo Awai","Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for lung nodule detection assist radiologists. As their performance using ultra-high-resolution CT (U-HRCT) images has not been evaluated, we investigated the usefulness of 0.25-mm slices at U-HRCT using the commercially available deep-learning-based lung nodule detection (DL-LND) system.",
Prevalence and genomic insights into Yersinia enterocolitica in Southeastern China (2008-2022).,"Lei Fang, Shuxuan Li, Jie Rong, Shengkai Li, Yuwen Zhang, Huihuang Lou, Zhongbi Xie, Yuqin Hu, Yuejin Wu, Airong Xie, Yi Li","Yersinia enterocolitica is a significant foodborne pathogen causing gastrointestinal illnesses worldwide. This study investigates the prevalence and genomic characteristics of Y. enterocolitica to assess potential health risks in southeastern China, a region lacking mandatory yersiniosis monitoring. From 2939 samples collected between 2008 and 2022, 105 isolates were recovered. The highest prevalence was found in rodents (8.1%), followed by retail meats (7.1%), other foods (3.7%), and human clinical cases (0.8%). In addition to meats and rodents, ready-to-eat salads, seafood, and frozen food products were identified as potential transmission vehicles. Various bioserotypes and sequence types (STs) was identified, including twelve previously unreported STs. Biotype 1A, exhibiting greater genetic diversity than more pathogenic biotypes (3 and 4), was frequently found in human clinical cases. Phylogenetic analysis revealed two main lineages, with isolates primarily clustered by biotype and pathogenic traits. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed 46.7% (49/105) of isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR), with frequent resistance to polymyxin B (100%), azithromycin (50.5%), and sulfanilamide isoxazole (31.4%). These findings highlight the ecological complexity and diversity of Y. enterocolitica, especially non-pathogenic biotype 1A strains, and underscore the need for enhanced food safety and antimicrobial stewardship to mitigate the public health impact of Y. enterocolitica infections. KEY POINTS: Biotype 1â€‰A strains exhibited greater genetic diversity than pathogenic biotypes. Pathogenic strains were mainly associated with lineage HC1490_2, not HC1490_10. Higher MDR levels were observed in biotype 3 and 4 strains.",
