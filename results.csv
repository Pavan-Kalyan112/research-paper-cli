"40631259","KAT6A/B inhibition synergizes with retinoic acid and enhances the efficacy of GD2-targeted immunotherapy in neuroblastoma.","Nina Weichert-Leahey, Alla Berezovskaya, Mark W Zimmerman, Francesca Alvarez-Calderon, Marlana Winschel, Silvi Salhotra, Nathaniel Mabe, Antonio Perez-Atayde, Francisca N de L Vitorino, Benjamin Garcia, Ulrike Gerdemann, Kimberly Stegmaier, Adam D Durbin, Derek A Oldridge, Brian J Abraham, A Thomas Look","High-risk neuroblastoma accounts for about 15% of childhood cancer deaths and arises from precursors of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system. Retinoids are clinically used to inhibit growth of neuroblastoma cells through reconfiguration of the regulatory enhancer landscape. Its effects, however, are completely reversible after drug withdrawal, leading to rapid tumor cell proliferation. Here, we sought to identify epigenetic modifiers that potentiate the antiproliferative effects of retinoids in neuroblastoma. We identified PF-9363, an inhibitor of the histone H3K23 acetyltransferases KAT6A/B, as synergistically inhibiting neuroblastoma growth in combination with retinoids. PF-9363 plus retinoids induces durable growth arrest, which persists beyond retinoid withdrawal ","2025","","","High-risk neuroblastoma accounts for about 15% of childhood cancer deaths and arises from precursors of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system.

"40631163","TLR2 signaling uniquely destabilizes tumor Tregs to promote cancer immunotherapy.","Timothy F Campbell, Jesse Garcia Castillo, Sebastian Fernandez, Diego Gonzalez Ventura, Jenna Vickery, Stefan Homentcovschi, Nicole Flores Hernandez, Julia Ybarra, Daniel A Portnoy, Michel DuPage","A fundamental principle of immune responses is that innate immunity promotes adaptive immunity, but in the context of cancer immunity, the importance of innate receptor signaling is poorly defined. To study how Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling contributes to cancer immunity, we used an attenuated strain of Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) that inhibits tumor growth in mice. We found that Lm stimulation of TLR2, but not TLR5 or TLR9, was essential for tumor control. As expected, TLR2 supported the priming of Lm-specific T cells in lymphoid tissues. However, TLR2 signaling in innate immune cells within tumors also destabilized Foxp3 expression in regulatory T cells (Tregs), a function that was not mediated by other TLRs. Reduced Treg function promoted tumor antigen cross-presentation by DC1s to enhance the functionality of recalled tumor-specific CD8+ T cells directly within tumors. These findings reveal a unique capacity for TLR2 signaling to diminish immunosuppression and promote cancer immunity.","2025","","","A fundamental principle of immune responses is that innate immunity promotes adaptive immunity, but in the context of cancer immunity, the importance of innate receptor signaling is poorly defined.

"40631140","Longitudinal Proteomic Profiling of T Cell Differentiation In Vivo Reveals Biochemical Remodeling Underlying Exhaustion.","Christian M Beusch, Abdelhameed S Dawood, Ahmet Ozdilek, Sarah Welbourn, Youssef M Zohdy, Christopher M Monaco, Alexandra S Flegle, Ahmed Mahgoub, Sakshi Malik, Christina Niavi, Akil Akhtar, Carly Roman, Autumn A Gavora, David E Gordon, Mohamed S Abdel-Hakeem","CD8 T cell exhaustion impedes immune responses to cancer and chronic infections, and a biochemical understanding of exhaustion is essential to improving immunotherapy. Here, we present the first longitudinal protein abundance and phosphoproteomic analysis of antigen-specific CD8 T cells undergoing differentiation in vivo during acute (LCMV-Armstrong) and chronic (LCMV-Clone 13) infection. Comparing protein abundance across the two infection conditions identified over 180 known and novel exhaustion-associated proteins, including proteins missed by transcriptional analyses. Phosphoproteomic analysis identified >900 differentially regulated phosphosites on >400 proteins, including known inhibitory phosphosites on PD1, PAG1, SHP-1/PTPN6, SLAMF1/CD150. We also calculated phosphosite conservation across mammals, to direct follow-up studies towards sites with likely essential function. Lastly, our analysis uncovers exhaustion-associated kinases with clinical-stage inhibitors, underscoring the translational utility of our dataset to guide immunotherapy development. Together, our datasets define a biochemical atlas of T cell exhaustion in vivo, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms of T cell dysfunction.","2025","","","CD8 T cell exhaustion impedes immune responses to cancer and chronic infections, and a biochemical understanding of exhaustion is essential to improving immunotherapy.

"40630962","Benign tumors broaden the field of application for immunotherapy.","Mohamed A Youssef, Hisham Al-Sharif, Brian T McGrath, Maria M Picken, I Caroline Le Poole","Immunotherapy has shown significant potential for treating malignancies. Not yet widely considered is the opportunity to employ immunotherapy for the treatment of benign tumors. By focusing on targetable antigens expressed following specific genetic changes associated with individual benign tumors, immunotherapy may provide an effective approach to benign tumor treatment, circumventing the need for more conventional surgery. Immunotherapies can specifically recognize and target tumor cells, which could be especially beneficial for benign tumors given the extended timeframe available for treatment. Thus, benign tumors, offering a greater window of opportunity for treatment and a relatively stable phenotype associated with a limited mutation burden, can derive great benefit from immunotherapeutic approaches targeting antigens uniquely associated with each condition.","2025","","","Immunotherapy has shown significant potential for treating malignancies.
